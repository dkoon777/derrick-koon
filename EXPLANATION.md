# Agent Reasoning and Design Explanation

AI Research Scout supports CTO, VC, and Tech Leader personas.

## Reasoning Flow
1. Interpret persona and decision context
2. Gemini-powered task decomposition
3. Parallel signal retrieval
4. Comparative synthesis
5. Decision-oriented output

## Tool Integration
Gemini is used for planning and synthesis. Retrieval agents gather bounded, high-signal artifacts.

## Limitations
- Heuristic scoring
- Non-exhaustive retrieval
- Advisory output

## Future Enhancements
- VC startup technical diligence
- CTO implementation strategies
- Tech Leader talent and training recommendations
